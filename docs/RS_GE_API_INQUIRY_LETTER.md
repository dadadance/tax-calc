**Subject: Inquiry Regarding API Access for Individual Taxpayer Personal Data**

Dear RS.ge Support Team,

I am writing to inquire about API access for individual taxpayers to retrieve their personal tax data programmatically.

## Background

We are developing a tax calculation tool for individuals in Georgia and would like to integrate with RS.ge to allow users to import their personal tax data directly. We have successfully implemented manual file import functionality (CSV/Excel exports), but we are exploring whether API access is available for a more seamless user experience.

## Mutual Benefits

By providing API access for personal taxpayer data, RS.ge would not only help taxpayers better understand and manage their tax obligations, but also reduce the burden on RS.ge's call center and support services. When taxpayers can easily access and analyze their own data through third-party tools, they are:
- Less likely to need assistance with basic tax calculations
- Better informed about their tax situation before contacting support
- Able to resolve questions independently using accurate, real-time data

This creates a win-win situation: taxpayers get better tools, and RS.ge's support team can focus on more complex inquiries.

## Questions

1. **Does RS.ge provide API access for individual taxpayers to retrieve their personal tax data?**
   - Income declarations
   - Tax payment history
   - Property information
   - Business registration status (for individual entrepreneurs)

2. **If API access is available:**
   - What are the API endpoints?
   - What authentication method is required? (We tested `https://crsapi.rs.ge/` with portal credentials but authentication failed)
   - Is there developer documentation available?
   - What are the registration/activation requirements?
   - Are there any fees or subscriptions required?

3. **Regarding CRS API (`https://crsapi.rs.ge/`):**
   - What is the purpose of this API?
   - Is it for individual taxpayers or business/financial institutions only?
   - What authentication method does it use?

4. **If API access is not available for personal taxpayer data:**
   - Is manual export (CSV/Excel) the only option?
   - Are there any plans to provide API access in the future?

## Current Implementation

We have successfully implemented:
- Manual file import (CSV/Excel) from RS.ge portal exports ✅
- Data mapping and validation
- Integration with our tax calculation tool

We would like to enhance this with direct API integration if available.

## Contact Information

If you need any additional information or clarification, please feel free to contact us.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
